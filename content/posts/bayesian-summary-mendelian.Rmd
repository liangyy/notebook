# Idea

This paper is to perform the mediation analysis using GWAS summary statistic and eQTL data. The goal is to infer whether gene expression mediates the genotype-phenotype association. The idea is to incorperate multiple genes and multiple SNPs to take LD into account. Also, the unmediated effect is also modelled explicitly.

# Model

\begin{align*}
  y &\sim N(G\theta, \sigma^2 I) \\
  \theta &= \sum_{k = 1}^K \beta_k \vec\alpha_k + \vec\gamma
\end{align*}
, where $\beta_k$ is the effect of gene $k$ expression on phenotype. $\vec\gamma$ is unmediated effect of genotype on phenotype. $\vec{\alpha}_k$ is the effect of genotype on gene $k$. 

Here, the idea comes from the fact that $\hat\theta$ coming from single-effect model (GWAS summary statistic) follows $\hat\theta \sim N(SRS^{-1}\theta, SRS)$ where $\theta$ is the effect of true multi-site model. Following this idea, the paper proposed a likelihood function for $\hat\theta$ given $\hat\alpha$. Specifically, $\hat\theta \sim N(SRS^{-1} \sum_{k = 1}^K \hat{\vec\alpha_k} \beta_k + \vec\gamma, SRS)$. 

The ultimate goal is to infer $\beta_k$ with the consideration of $\vec\gamma$. So, a spike-and-slab prior is assigned to $\beta_k$ and a normal prior is assigned to $\vec\gamma$. One more techical note is that variational Bayes was used in inference where LD matrix $R$ is replaced by a low rank approximation to ensure efficient/stable computaton. 

# In practice

The paper defined only considered genes with at least on eQTL with p-value > 0.05. All SNPs were included to allow unmediated effect explain away mediated effect. It is unclear what is computed for prioritizing genes, but it is likely to be PIP of $\beta_k$ for each gene $k$.
