# Motivation

The goal is to assess the genetic effect of the specific gene on the disease. In this paper, the authors casted the genetic effect as two parts:

  1. Effect through gene expression of the given gene
  2. Other genetic effect (i.e. splicing, but some gene-unrelated mechanisms are also possible as long as it is determined genetically, say enhancer activity)

The paper used genotype data along with paired gene expression data. The variables in the paper were:

  1. A set of SNPs within the gene ($S$)
  2. Expression level of the given gene ($G$)
  3. Disease status ($Y$)

The causal model is (Figure 1 of the paper):

```{r, echo=FALSE, engine="tikz", fig.ext='svg', out.width="30%", fig.align='center'}
\usetikzlibrary{arrows}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2cm, auto,>=latex, thick, scale = 0.5]
\node (s) {$S$};
\node (g) [right of=s] {$G$};
\node (x) [below of=g] {$X$};
\node (y) [right of=g] {$Y$};
\draw[->] (s) to (g);
\draw[->] (s) to[out=20, in=160] (y);
\draw[->] (g) to (y);
\draw[->] (x) to (s);
\draw[->] (x) to (g);
\draw[->] (x) to (y);
\end{tikzpicture}
```
