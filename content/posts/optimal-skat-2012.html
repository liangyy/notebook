<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>Rare variants have very low MAF so GWAS doesnâ€™t work under current sample size. To increase power, the strategy is to aggregate variants according to biological knowledge (or assumptions). There are two main types of tests: burden tests and non-burden tests. Burden test is region-based and it suffers from the assumption that all rare variants have the same direction of the effect and the power is low if there are too many non-causal variants. The non-burden test, sequence kernel association test (SKAT) does not make such assumption but it is less powerful than burden test if the assumption is <em>almost true</em>. <strong>The motivation</strong> of this paper is to propose a general version of hypothesis test which includes burden/non-burden tests as special cases. It provides a way to maximize the power no matter how the true model looks like.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-approach" class="section level1">
<h1>The approach</h1>
<p>They proposed to construct a class of test that is an arbitrary linear combination of burden test and SKAT statistics. The optimal test could be identified by maximizing the power within the class.</p>
<p>The goal is to test whether the rare variants in a single region are associated with a complex trait. Suppose sample size is <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and the number of SNVs is <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th subject, <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> is phenotype and <span class="math inline">\(G_i = (g_{i1}, ..., g_{ip})\)</span> is genotype where <span class="math inline">\(g_{ij} = 0, 1, 2\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(X_i = (x_{i1}, ..., x_{iq})\)</span> is the covariates that are needed to be adjusted for. For continuous/categorical phenotypes, they used generalized linear model where <span class="math inline">\(\E(y_{i}) = \mu_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\var(y_i) = \phi \nu(\mu_i)\)</span> with a link function</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    g(\mu_i) &amp;= X_i \alpha + G_i \beta \label{eq:glm}
  \end{align}\]</span>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\nu(\cdot)\)</span> is a variance function and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha, \beta\)</span> are the vectors of regression coefficients for covariates and rare variants. With <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:glm}\)</span>, the test for association can be constructed as <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \beta = (\beta_1, ..., \beta_p)&#39; = \vec{0}\)</span>. But such test suffers from large degree of freedom (d.f.) (<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>). To reduce d.f., additional assumptions were made.</p>
<div id="burden-based-tests" class="section level2">
<h2>Burden-based tests</h2>
<p>The popular <strong>burden-based tests</strong> reduce the d.f. by making the assumptions that each <span class="math inline">\(\beta_j\)</span> is a function of the MAFs such that <span class="math inline">\(\beta_j = w(m_j) = w_j\beta_0\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(m_j\)</span> is the MAF of the <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>th variant. With this assumption, <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:glm}\)</span> becomes:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    g(\mu_i) &amp;= X_i \alpha + \beta_0 \sum_{j = 1}^p w_j g_{ij} \label{eq:burden}
  \end{align}\]</span>
<p>Then the test <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \beta_0 = 0\)</span> has 1 d.f. The test was referred as weighted counting burden test (WBT).</p>
</div>
<div id="skat" class="section level2">
<h2>SKAT</h2>
<p><strong>SKAT</strong> takes a different approach to reduce d.f. It assumes that each <span class="math inline">\(\beta_j\)</span> independently follows an arbitrary distribution with mean zero and variance <span class="math inline">\(w_j^2 \psi\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(w_j\)</span> is a fixed number that may depend on MAF. With this assumption, the null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \beta = \vec{0}\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \psi\)</span> under variance component test in GLMM. Suppose</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(n \times q\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(n \times p\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(W = \diag(w_1, ..., w_p)\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math inline">\(K = GWWG&#39;\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> is an weighted linear kernel matrix. SKAT paper proposed to use a class of flexible weight functions of MAF, <span class="math inline">\(w_j = \text{Beta}(m_j, a_1, a_2)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a_1, a_2\)</span> were pre-specified and <span class="math inline">\(m_j\)</span> were estimated using the sample MAF of the <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>th variant.</p>
<p>Define the working vector by <span class="math inline">\(y^* = X\alpha + \Delta (y - \mu)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta = \diag\{g&#39;(\mu_i))\)</span>, and the variance matrix by <span class="math inline">\(V = \diag(\phi \nu(\mu_i)[g&#39;(\mu_i)]\}\)</span>. The estimates under the null were: <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{y} = X\hat\alpha + \hat\Delta (y - \hat\mu)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat\Delta = \diag\{g&#39;(\hat\mu_i))\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{V} = \diag(\phi \nu(\hat\mu_i)[g&#39;(\hat\mu_i)]\}\)</span>. Where all estimates were obtained under the null hypothesis. It <em>turned out</em> that the score test statistic of the variance component <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> is</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    Q &amp;= (\tilde{y} - X\alpha)&#39; \hat{V}^{-1} K \hat{V}^{-1} (\tilde{y} - X\hat\alpha) \nocr
    &amp;= (y - \hat\mu)&#39; \hat\Delta \hat{V}^{-1} K \hat{V}^{-1} \hat\Delta (y - \hat\mu) \nonumber
  \end{align}\]</span>
<p>This result follows from the derivation of the variance component test of GLMM in this <a href="{{< ref "posts/variance-component-test-glmm-1997.html" >}}">paper</a> equation 8.</p>

<h2>This paper proposed</h2>
<p>The weighted linear kernel was constructed under the assumption that <span class="math inline">\(\beta_j\)</span>s were independent. But it is not true if the region is of high risk to have deleterious mutations. <strong>This paper</strong> introduced a new family of kernels. They proposed to allow <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> to follow a multivariate distribution with exchangable correlation structure. Let the correlation matrix of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> be <span class="math inline">\(R_\rho = (1 - \rho)I + \rho \vec{1} \vec{1}&#39;\)</span>. Then the SKAT test statistic becomes</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    Q_{\rho} = (y - \hat\mu)&#39; \hat\Delta \hat{V}^{-1} K_\rho \hat{V}^{-1} \hat\Delta (y - \hat\mu) \nonumber
  \end{align}\]</span>
<p>This family of statistic contains both WBT and SKAT:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\rho = 0\)</span>, it becomes SKAT</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\rho = 1\)</span>, it becomes WBT</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, <span class="math inline">\(Q_\rho = (1 - \rho) Q_{SKAT} + \rho Q_{burden}\)</span>. For a fixed <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Q_\rho\)</span> follows a mixture of <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> distributions. Namely if <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_m\)</span> are eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{V}^{-1/2}K_\rho\hat{V}^{-1/2}\)</span>, the null distribution of <span class="math inline">\(Q_\rho\)</span> can be closely approximated by <span class="math inline">\(\sum \lambda_j \chi_{1, j}^2\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{1, j}^2\)</span>s are iid <span class="math inline">\(\chi_1^2\)</span> random variables. The p-values can be obtained by <em>matching moments or inverting characteristic function</em>.</p>
