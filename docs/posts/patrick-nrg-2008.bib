abstract = {The two-locus, two-allele multiplicative viability model is investigated. It is shown that the well-known region of recombination values for which D = 0 is locally stable does not preclude the local stability of an equilibrium with D ≠ 0. This is shown numerically and is true for every case investigated in which both loci are overdominant and the viabilities not symmetric.},
