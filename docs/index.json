I googled this term and found this site. Also, wiki page is informative.\nIt appears in regression analysis where $y$ is the responsive variable and $x$ is the explanatory variable. The model is simply $Y = X \\beta + \\epsilon$. Suppose $Z$ correlates with $X$ and $Z$ is independent to $Y$ given $X$, then $Z$ correlates with $Y$ as well despite such conditional independence.\nIn some analysis, people sort of take the advantage of $Z$ (in this context $Z$ is called instrumental variable). In regression model, the underlying assumption is that $\\epsilon$ is independent to $X$. But it is hard to achieve if there is some other unknown variable $U$ that affect both $X$ and $Y$. In this case, error term \u0026ldquo;absorbs\u0026rdquo; the dependencies in $U$ which leads to the violence of $X \\independent \\epsilon$ (the following graph is an example).\ngraph LR; Z((Z)) --- X((X)) X --- Y((Y)) U((U)) --- Y X --- U E((error)) --- Y  In this case, $Y \\sim X$ cannot distinguish $U$ and $\\epsilon$ but $Y \\sim Z$ does not have such problem since the effect of $U$ is captured by $X$ and $\\epsilon$ is disentangled.\nThe idea of MR can be illustrated by the following graph:\ngraph LR; Z(variant) --- X(gene expression) X --- Y(phenotype) U(unknown factors) --- Y X --- U E(error) --- Y  Motivation "
